* Todo Basics
	This is a simple study in managing your daily ins and outs using OrgExtended.
	Org is a swiss army knife. It is, what you make of it.

	Basic note taking is pretty straight forward.

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ** Headings
     We are taking some notes, I have an idea that idea
  *** Sub Idea 1
	 Has some parts
  **** Sub Sub Idea 1
	   More info
  *** Sub Idea 2
	  Another part of that
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	As I am taking notes I realize I have some things I need to do.
	Org expects that todos come up anywhere in your work. The agenda
	and todo lists exist to find your work and who it to you.

	You can convert any heading into a todo item.
	You can define a project as a macro todo with sub tasks that have the
	TODO keyword. You can set a schedule or deadline fairly easily.
	This will cause this task to show up in your agenda.

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    * TODO Project A
      SCHEDULED: <2021-02-15 Mon 22:41> 
    ** TODO Task 1
    *** This is a sub task  
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	At this point you have a simple todo list, it is in the middle of my notes!
	This is where the agenda comes in.
