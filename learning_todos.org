* Todo Basics
	This is a simple study in managing your daily ins and outs using OrgExtended.
	Org is a swiss army knife. It is, what you make of it. 

	[[file:images/learning_todo_headings.gif]]

	Keybindings for these operations can be found in the keybindings file.
	You can find the keymap in the package settings menus.

	- For regular users most of the org bindings are under Alt+o
	- For NeoVintageous users most of the bindings are behind <space> in normal mode with the same followers as the Alt+o equivalents

	Here I am using insert heading and insert child. 

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	Alt+o i h and Alt+o i c
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	Another way to do this is to use Ctrl+Enter
	This runs the Do What I Mean (DWIM) Insert mechanism.

	- If you are on a checklist it will insert a checklist.
	- If you are on a numbered list it will insert a new entry.
	- If you are on a heading it will insert a new heading.

	Basic note taking is pretty straight forward.

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ** Headings
     We are taking some notes, I have an idea that idea
  *** Sub Idea 1
	 Has some parts
  **** Sub Sub Idea 1
	   More info
  *** Sub Idea 2
	  Another part of that
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	As I am taking notes I realize I have some things I need to do.
	Org expects that todos come up anywhere in your work. The agenda
	and todo lists exist to find your work and who it to you.

	You can convert any heading into a todo item.
	You can define a project as a macro todo with sub tasks that have the
	TODO keyword. You can set a schedule or deadline fairly easily.
	This will cause this task to show up in your agenda.

	[[file:images/learning_todo_todos.gif]]

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    * TODO Project A
      SCHEDULED: <2021-02-15 Mon 10:41> 
    ** TODO Task 1
    *** This is a sub task  
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	The same DWIM trick works for toggling things.

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  <space> t
	  Alt+o t
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	Will toggle state and checkboxes. You can also use the *"Org Change Todo"* command.

* Org Everywhere

	While this is useful, todos are more useful if you can access them from everywhere.
	Org becomes more useful if you can access your org files from your mobile device.
	I find it handy to store my todo lists in dropbox while my notes are often stored
	in a git repository. There are several mobile orgmode viewers. I personally use Orgzly.

* Agenda

	At this point you have a simple todo list, it is in the middle of my notes!
	This is where the agenda comes in. There are a ton of agenda views and I hope
	to help you build your own in the future. Based on how you have your agenda
	configured your agenda can find your todos in your files. It can also show
	you different views of your todos based on how you have categorized them.

	Here I am demonstrating opening the general todo listing and jumping to
	the todo. Type enter on the line and we open the todo. Type space and we
	open it in another window.

	I am also showing this task in the agenda. I pulled in the time a little
	and moved the schedule to the task for the demonstration. This is because
	I have my agenda restricted to only show working hours and it wouldn't
	make much of a demonstration if it did not appear on the agenda.

	[[file:images/learning_todo_agenda.gif]] 

	In the example I use the SCHEDULED marker. These are a powerful yet
	complicated part of org mode. We don't currently support the full gamut of
	org functionality, but I hope to in the future. In particular some of the recurrence
	options with timestamps is poorly supported, but will hopefully improve in the future.

	- SCHEDULED :: This marks where you want to START working on something it will appear in the agenda until you close the task. So generally this is used on tasks that may take some time.
	- DEADLINE :: Like scheduled this marks where you want to be DONE working on something. You can specify a warning marker in the time. By default you will get a warning 1 day before your deadline. If the task is still open after the deadline it will be marked as overdue.
	- < Active Timestamp > :: without a deadline or scheduled prefix this event will happen once at the selected time. 


* Priorities

	Org supports priorities. These are just simple tags that identify 
	how important this task is to you.

	[[file:images/learning_todo_priorities.gif]]

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    * A heading
    ** TODO [#B] Task 1
    ** TODO [#A] Task 2
    ** TODO Task 3
    ** TODO Task 4
    #+END_EXAMPLE


* Tagging

	As you get more todos things can get confusing without some way of organizing
	your efforts. Welcome to tags.

	You can tag any heading with a tag (or multiple tags. Once you have tagged it you can filter
	based on that tag. Here I am going to use a generic filtered todo view to only
	view todo items tagged with TA.

	[[file:images/learning_todo_tags.gif]]

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    * A heading
    ** TODO Task 1                                                            :TA:
    ** TODO Task 2
    ** TODO Task 3                                                            :TA:
    ** TODO Task 4
	#+END_EXAMPLE
