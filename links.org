* Links

  <<ThisIsATarget>>

  Links in org mode are a nested set of square brackets

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [[ Reference ][ Description ]]
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Pressing enter on a link in sublime will try to follow the link.
  If the link is a web reference org will try to open a web browser.

  The link system I am using is based on the original orgmode for sublime text and
  is fairly extensible. Custom handlers can be built to allow you to link easily to
  your own services.

  There are several special ways of locating within a file within a reference.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [[<PROTOCOL>:<FILENAME>::<LOCATOR>][<NAME>]]
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  To manually specify locators using special symbols:
  - Custom Id :: #<IDNAME>
  - Header :: *<HEADING TEXT>
  - Row Col :: Row::Col

  If your locator is only text and non numerical there is an order to how the text is matched:

  - Target
  - Custom Id
  - Header

* Targets
  Targets are like anchors in an html file.
  A target is specified using double angle brackets.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <<TEXT>>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Images
  Org supports the ability to show images inline in the document
  These are done with Sublimes phantom support under an image link and do not count as lines of text.
  Org can download links off the web that reference images into a cache and display them locally.
  This can lock up sublime while the images are downloaded so turn on visualization with care.

  - OrgShowAllImages - Shows all image links in the document
  - OrgHideAllImages - Hides all image links in the document
  - OrgShowImage - Shows a single image link in the document
  - OrgHideImage - Hides a single image link in the document

  NOTE: You can ask that sublime visualize images by default in a file using a startup comment:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+STARTUP: inlineimages
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* File and Line Number

  A link can be more than just the filename.
  You can link to a specific line number like so:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [[file:links.org::3][File and Line Number Example]]
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  [[file:./links.org::3][File and Line Number Example]]

* Linking to Headings

  You can link to a heading using a star.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [[file:./links.org::*Images][Images Example]]
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  [[file:./links.org::*Images][Images Example]]

  You can link without the star but it can match other things.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [[file:./links.org::Images][Images Example]]
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  [[file:./links.org::Images][Images Example]]

* Custom Ids
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-custom-id
  :END:

  Org has the concept of custom IDs. These are defined as a CUSTOM_ID property
  in a property drawer. To link to a heading with one of these IDs:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [[file:./links.org::#a-custom-id][Custom Id Example]]
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  [[file:./links.org::#a-custom-id][Custom Id Example]]

* Extending Link Processing
  TODO: Describe how to do this.
