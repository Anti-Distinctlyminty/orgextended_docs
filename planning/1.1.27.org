* 1.1.27 
   Core Goals: Extending datetime formula support
** Ian
  I am working towards this as my ultimate goal
  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ViUBaarsbw][Gantt Charts In Org]] 

  For 1.1.26 I am hoping to have the full creation of the table
  functional, but with some added bells and whistles that allow
  you to create that table dynamically directly in the columnview
  rather than having to build the table every time you want a gantt chart.

  - [ ] Support adding formulas to the generated table in the columnview description somehow
  - [ ] Support adding non existent columns in the columnview description (probably just property markers)
  - [ ] Support date() parsing cells
  - [ ] Support OrgDate converting back to a string properly
  - [ ] Support OrgDate + OrgDuration additions so you do not have to remove the d from the effort estimate.
  - [ ] Support percentage strings
  - [ ] Support if statement in tables 

** 1.1.27 Documentation Goals
  - [ ] Document advanced tables
  - [ ] Audit other major features that I might have forgotten?
