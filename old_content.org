* Checkboxes

	Before we get to far down the road of managing todos. It helps to see some of the rich things you can add to your
	todos. Org supports the usual *bold* =verbatim= _underscore_ /italic/ and a host of other markers.
	In addition to that there are some rich items that you can add as content. Lets take a quick aside to skim
	just a few ot those.

  Sometimes you just need a quick list!
  Here I am using the DWIM style Ctrl+Enter to add new entries and the DWIM toggle command to toggle the checkbox
  entries.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  - [x] Checkbox list
  - [x] More in the list [100%] 
      - [x] Sub list!
      - [x] More
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Lists
	
	While our support for it is still in its infancy and sometimes buggy, Do What I Mean or DWIM style editing is a corner stone of
	orgmode. This sort of automatic insertion should work with headings, lists, numbered lists and checkboxes. Adding the shift modifier should
	cause the DWIM insertion to append to the end of the list rather than
	adding right at point.

* Tables

	Org has fancy tables, they behave very much like spreadsheets. We don't quite have that yet.
	But we are headed in that direction! Thanks to the excellent Table Editor plugin, here I am using tab to skip to the next cell and reformat
	the table. Eventually I would like to have cell formulas and babel inputs like org.

	| Heading 1 | H2 |        H3       |
	|-----------+----+-----------------|
	| This      | is | something fancy |
	| Well      | a  | table at least  |
	|-----------+----+-----------------|

	You can insert blank tables using some helper methods:

	You can also convert a region dynamically into a table:

	[[file:images/convert_region_to_table.gif]]

	Table manipulation is much easier when you can reorganize the table dynamically.
	Here I am importing the table from a CSV and manipulating the table contents
	dynamically using the table keybindings:

	While still in its infancy/preview we have some rudimentary support for some of the org spreadsheet features

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  | Student  | Maths | Physics | Mean |
  |----------+-------+---------+------|
  | Bertrand |    13 |      09 | 11.0 |
  | Henri    |    15 |      14 | 14.5 |
  | Arnold   |    17 |      13 | 15.0 |
  #+TBLFM: $4=vmean($2..$3)
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	Org recommends you do not edit the actual TBLFM line. Instead insert your formulas directly into the cell
	with the formula. There are 2 primary operators := which will only update this cell and plain equals which will
	update the entire column.

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  | Student  | Maths | Physics |      Mean      |
  |----------+-------+---------+----------------|
  | Bertrand |    13 |      09 | =vmean($2..$3) |
  | Henri    |    15 |      14 |                |
  | Arnold   |    17 |      13 |                |
