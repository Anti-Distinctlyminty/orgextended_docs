* Priorities

	Org supports priorities. These are just simple tags that let you identify 
	how important this task is to you.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    * A heading
    ** TODO [#B] Task 1
    ** TODO [#A] Task 2
    ** TODO Task 3
    ** TODO Task 4
    #+END_EXAMPLE


    Priorities hold very little meaning to org itself.
    Priorities can be defined with the priorities comment.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+PRIORITIES: 1 2 3 4 5
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   or globally with the priorities settings in your OrgExtended settings file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
     "priorites": ["A","B","C","D","E"],
   #+END_SRC
