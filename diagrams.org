* Diagrams

** Showing Images

  Links to local files, when exported will show up as images in your document. 
  You can also see those images right in sublime.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Org Show Images
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Will show all the images in your document in inline popup phantoms right in your document.

** Creating Diagrams

  Src blocks can be used for things other than pure code.
  For instance, they can be used to make diagrams!

  Org Mode has support for some different ways of making diagrams.
  That said, we currently only support one, plantuml. 
  I only ever really used 2 ditaa and plantuml and I find ditaa is
  MUCH less useful if you don't have the emacs picture mode or artist mode
  to help you draw text diagrams in the first place.

  So, back to plantuml.

  1. You first need to have plantuml.jar somewhere useful
  2. You also need a copy of the java runtime environment and it HAS to be in your path
  3. In addition once you install those you should restart sublime, so sublime has your lastest path.
  4. Now tell OrgExtended where you have put plantuml.jar

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "plantuml": "C:\\path\\plantuml.jar",
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Now make a plantuml block like so:

  #+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file images/plantuml1.png
  title Authentication Sequence2

  Alice->Bob: Hello Request
  note right of Bob: Bob thinks about it
  Bob->Alice: Authentication Response
  #+END_SRC 

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:images\plantuml1.png]]
  
  


  Here I am telling plantuml to generate the image for this into my current directory images folder and to generate a png for me.
  To run this, put your cursor no plantuml and run:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Org Exec Source Block
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  [[file:images/diagrams_plantuml.gif]]
