* Tables and Spreadsheets
	Org Extended has some support for org mode tables. True org tables support would allow for arbitrary
	emacs lisp to run as cell formulas within the table. Org Extended is not likely to build a lisp
	interpreter within sublime. I am less likely to support the full gamut of useful lisp functions.

	That said, a lot can be done with basic calc support in sublime!

	There are a number of things that make org tables super powerful:

	- Org has a ton of power for editing and dynamically modifying tables, in plain text!
	- Org supports a full computation engine built on emacs calc. We have a simplified version of that.
	- Org tables can reference other tables. (Much like tabs in a spreadsheet)
	- Org tables can act as inputs to babel really opening up your options for living documents. (we do not have this yet)
	- Org tables can be the output of babel, again, really comming full circle on things. (we do not have this yet)
	- Org can easily import csv files and other document types into your documents. (we have some support here)

	That said, using the spreadsheet like capabilities of Org Extended will take a little effort on your part

** Basic Editing
	Tab and Shift Tab are your friend. To start building a table, put a vertical bar symbol followed by some text and press tab.
	Voila, you have a table!

	There is more. You can import a table or create a blank WxH table. But we will cover those later.

** Adding Rows and Columns

	Next we need to extend our table. It is a pain to have to go over to the righthand side of the table to add a column.
	Org lets you insert a column almost anywhere!

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	Shift+Alt+Right Arrow  --> Add a Col (pull it out, text grows to the right in english)
	Shift+Alt+Left Arrow   --> Remove a Col (push it back)
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	The same works vertically!

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  Shift+Alt+Down Arrow --> Add a row (pull it out, tables grow down right!)
	  Shift+Alt+Up   Arrow --> Remove a row (push it back)
	#+END_EXAMPLE

** Moving Cells Around
	So now you realize that you laid out your table poorly and want to move the content around.
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	Alt+Right Arrow  --> Move this row right
	Alt+Left Arrow   --> Move this row left
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	The same works vertically!

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  Alt+Down Arrow --> Move this row down
	  Alt+Up   Arrow --> Move this row up 
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	The cool thing you will see later is that org tries to preserve formula correctness as well when you move your
	cells around. But more on that in a sec.

** Adding a Formula

	Okay so now you have a table with some content that you hand authored. It's time to start adding some smarts to your table!

	go to a cell and add a = followed by your formula... We will get to what that looks like in a sec.
	Then tell org about that formula and it will now be part of the table!
