* Exporting
  Org is first and foremost a document interchange format, much like markdown.
  There are many tools to work with markdown files and org files alike.

  OrgExtended has a couple of mechanisms that can allow you to convert between
  your org files and other formats.


*** Current Exporters

  1. [[file:pandoc.org][Pandoc]]   - This is a well known tool. You will need to install it.
  2. [[file:htmlexporter.org][Html]]     - Simple built in HTML exporter. 
  3. [[file:revealjs.org][RevealJs]] - An imitation of the emacs revealjs exporter.
