* Builtin HTML Exporter
  Much like the reveal exporter OrgExtended has a simple
  builtin HTML exporter.

** Theming
   The exporter works off the concept of a theme.
   Your theme can be specified in several ways:

   - In your sublime config file 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        "HtmlStyle": "blocky",
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   - In the files header
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE TYPE
        #+HTML_STYLE: blocky  
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   Styles are defined as a grouping of files in an htmlstyles subfolder of your User directory.
   These files are:

   - <style>.css
   - <style>_inheader.html
   - <style>_heading.html
   - <style>_footing.html

   You can extend these using either config values or additional header comments in your file:

   - HtmlInHeader HTML_INHEADER
   - HtmlHeading  HTML_HEADING
   - HtmlFooting  HTML_FOOTING
   - HtmlCss      HTML_CSS

   By default the exporter embeds highlightjs into the output to allow source blocks to be colorized.
   I may extend this in the future.
