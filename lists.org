* Lists
  Org supports a number of different types of lists.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - Minus sign is an unordered list
    - More stuff
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Minus sign is your basic unordered list.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    + Plus sign is another type of list
    + More stuff 
    #+END_EXAMPLE 

    Plus sign mixes it up with another type of list.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    1. Numbered lists are valid as well
    2. More stuff 
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Numbered lists are also supported, but minimally at the moment.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - Item :: Definition   
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Definition lists are an orgmode thing. We highlight them but have no
    other support for that at the moment.

** Checkboxes

	Checkboxes are also a sort of a mini todo item.
	They are very handy!

** Numbered Lists
  Numbered lists are always a pain to author. The list tools can use the standard recal command
  to reorder a list for you automatically.

  In addition adding to a numbered list is supported by the OrgAppendNumberedList command.
